## Background

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com).

```sh
1. $ npm install --global
2. $ npm start
```

## Usage

This project is to showcase an alternate of obtaining a classname without the use of document.getElementsByClassName and converting an object to string without the use of JSON.stringify.
